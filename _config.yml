  Hi. I'm Felix a professional and passionate software engineer 
  located in North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. 
  My main objectives are SOLID C# backends and typescript frontends.
  Beside that I also enjoy writing some Ruby, Python or Elixir 
  for recreational purposes. 
  In my spare time I like to play around with everything that contains 
  the letters IoT and needs soldering.
