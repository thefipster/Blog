  Hi. I'm Felix a professional and passionate software engineer 
  located in North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. 
  My main objectives are writing SOLID software with C#.
  Beside that I also enjoy writing some Typescript, Ruby, Python, Elixir or Prolog. 
  Let's be honest, in the end it all boils down to allocations, conditions and loops...
  In my spar(s)e time I like to play around with everything that contains 
  the letters IoT and needs soldering.
