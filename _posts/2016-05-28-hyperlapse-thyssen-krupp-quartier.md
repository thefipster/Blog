At last, I finished writing some papers and got some time again. But I didn’t 
want to spend it right back at the computer (okay to be honest I did, but not 
completely ;)) and so I tought: Hmm, reviving one of my old hobbies sounds like 
a good idea: Timelapse photography. Since we all need to evolve I wanted to add 
something new and decided to do a hyperlapse. As a target, I choose the 
Thyssen-Krupp-Quartier located in Essen, Germany. It’s the “new” headquarter of 
a huge steel manufacturing company constructed a few years ago and looks pretty 
nice.

Here are the variables of the painstaking 100 min process of capturing the 
images:

Camera: **Samsung NX300**  
Lens: **18-50mm 3.5-5.6**  
Total images: **400**  
Interval between images: **15s**  
Distance between images: **35cm**  
Focal length: **18mm**  
Shutter delay: **2.5s**  
Aperture: **auto (varied between 7.1 and 10)**  
White balance: **auto**  
ISO: **100**  
Filter: **ND8x + ND64x**

If you watch the video carefully, you will see that I fucked up two frames, 
where I momentarily lost concentration and moved the camera before the shutter 
closed, damn it!!! Still I hope you enjoy watching it, because I’m definitely 
going to do more.
