At the moment itâ€™s little bit quite in here, I guess some people already have 
seen some tumbleweed flying byâ€¦ well, thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m currently putting 
most of my free time into my other project â€“ [The Microdudes][1].

{% include image.html slug=page.slug image="title" %}

Take a look there to see my latest project: A remote controlled Nerfgun. 

* [Part 1 - More power][2]
* [Part 2 - Adding remote capabilities][3]

Basically I took an Arduino, integrated it inside the Nerfgun and added an 
Ethernet Connection. The next part which will be published soon, will then 
cover the installation of a Nano Wifi Router and the Phone App to control the 
Nerfgun remotely.

Have fun and if you got some further ideas, please tell me ðŸ˜‰
