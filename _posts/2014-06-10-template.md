## Heading

They're responsive, and well-proportioned 
(in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).

### Heading

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual 
hierarchy. Yay. But please don't use heading 1 in the post. That is resevered 
for the post title above this content.

## Code, with syntax highlighting

Code blocks use the [peppermint][1] theme.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Awesome < ActiveRecord::Base
  include EvenMoreAwesome

  validates_presence_of :something
  validates :email, email_format: true

  def initialize(email, name = nil)
    self.email = email
    self.name = name
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

## There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

## Images look great, too

{% include image.html slug=page.slug image="bunny" %}

{% include image.html slug=page.slug image="m104" %}

{% include image.html slug=page.slug image="earth-rise" %}

## Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.
